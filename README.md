# Bicentenary Hero <br> 🥇 Winner- Crea Digital 2019 Transmedia Storytelling

**CREATI** is an Android augmented reality application where
videos, audios, 3d models, and photos can merge
into real life on amazing and customizable
compositions. As a part of the **GUARDIANES**
project, this tool allows users to overcome their
status of tech consumers and empowers them as a
creator of digital content.
This idea started in 2018 in a conversation with my
developer partner **Milton Mahecha**. Our
experiences teaching at schools and as developers
show us how conditions like connectivity,
antiquated equipment, or software licenses,
impossibilities perform activities in some public
schools. Keeping this in mind, we decided to start
investing personal time on this project, and now it
has become a reliable tool for the company.

## How it works ⚙️
